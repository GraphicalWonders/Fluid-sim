# Fluid-sim
This is a fluid sim I made in C++. Further explanation is provided in the code and the accompanying PDF files.
Use this in anyway you want, may it be as a profile banner or as a cool thing to just have. Feel free to edit and use the code however you wish. No credit is required!
Note in order to run this code you need to include GLFW, glew and glm for the code to compile correctly :) Other than that it's just to run the code!
If you don't feel like compiling the code yourself, the release includes a zip folder with an exe file.
